# Program Summary
This program is a basic hands on for anyone introduced to automation.  
I developed a website that can be rendered in your local host and this Selenium project will automate that local site.  
You can find my simple webserver [renderHtml](https://github.com/0x218/Go/tree/master/renderHtml)
